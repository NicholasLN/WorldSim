# World Sim Rust Project

This is the framework for a future project of mine, which ventures into the workings of a government.
Included are foundational systems for territory management, role management, government legislative chambers, government powers, etc.
In the future this will be used to create an all-encompassing political simulation game modelling the diverse nature of governments IRL.
